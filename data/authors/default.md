Hi friends! Call me Bel.

I am passionate about asking more questions than I have time to answer. Some questions that move me are:

1. How do individuals and collectives evolve through the engagement within different spaces?
2. What is consciousness? Where does it come from? How does it evolve in individuals? How did it develop over the course of human evolution?
3. What is Qualia?
4. How do we address fragmentation in our postmodern world?
5. How do I become the best version of myself? :)

Always down to chat about anything! Let's go grab some good food and go on a scenic walk. I mean it!

## Present:

Creating community spaces of creativity, discourse, and play. Writing essays that I'll take more than eternity to complete. Independent research. Chopping wood and urban farming for fun. Currently reading Orthodoxy by GK Chesterton, and Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig. Other stuff that I'll keep underwraps because I like to maintain some mystery!

## Past:

In past lives I:

1. Did debate and public speaking on stages around the world.
2. With little entrepreneurship/innovation experience, I co-founded a non-profit for entrepreneurship and innovation. I got to consult cool companies, create fun events, as well as build products.
3. Made a podcast on art, philosophy, social commentary, and literature! Actually, it isn't that deep. It's just 2-3 hour long chats with people I like about random things.
4. Was a DeFi girlie @ Intellabridge Tech
5. Was a finance/swe girlie @ GAF

## Future:

I would like to be able to do a pull up. Also go to space!

The possibilities are endless.
