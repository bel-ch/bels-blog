Hi friends! Call me Bel.

## Present:

Creating community spaces of radical co-creation. Not writing essays. Trying to read. Boxing and muay thai for funz!

## Past:

In past lives I:

1. Did debate and public speaking around the world.
2. With little entrepreneurship/innovation experience, I co-founded a non-profit for entrepreneurship and innovation. I got to consult cool companies, create fun events, as well as build products. @SparkathonBB
3. Made a very silly podcast on art, philosophy, social commentary, and literature!
4. Lead teams and curated marketing strategies @ Intellabridge Tech
5. Built software and managed finances @ GAF
6. Built a carbon zero building @ UBC with Third Quadrant Design
7. Helped run a festival and parade @ Vancouver Pride

## Future:

I would like to be able to do a pull up. Also go to space!

The possibilities are endless.
