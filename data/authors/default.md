Hi friends! Call me Bel.

I am passionate about asking more questions than I have time to answer. Some questions that move me are:

1. How do individuals and collectives evolve through the engagement within different spaces?
2. What is consciousness? Where does it come from? How does it evolve in individuals? How did it develop over the course of human evolution?
3. What is Qualia?
4. How do we address fragmentation in our postmodern world?
5. How do I become the best version of myself? :)

Always down to chat!

## Present:

Creating community spaces of creativity, discourse, and play. Writing essays that I'll take more than eternity to complete. Independent research. No answers, still trying to figure out the question. Alot of pontificating. Chopping wood and urban farming for fun. Currently reading Orthodoxy by GK Chesterton, and Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig.

## Past:

In past lives I:

1. Did debate and public speaking on stages around the world.
2. With little entrepreneurship/innovation experience, I co-founded a non-profit for entrepreneurship and innovation. I got to consult cool companies, create fun events, as well as build products. @SparkathonBB
3. Made a podcast on art, philosophy, social commentary, and literature! Actually, it isn't that deep. It's just 2-3 hour long chats with people I like about random things.
4. Lead teams and curated marketing strategies @ Intellabridge Tech
5. Built software and managed finances @ GAF
6. Built a carbon zero building @ UBC with Third Quadrant Design

## Future:

I would like to be able to do a pull up. Also go to space!

The possibilities are endless.
